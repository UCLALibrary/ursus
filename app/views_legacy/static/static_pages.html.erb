      The UCLA Digital Library does not handle requests for reproductions or permissions to publish. All requests for reproductions or permissions to publish should be directed to the item's holding repository. The name of the home repository can be found in either the item-level metadata (see an example) or in the collection record (example). In most cases, this will be the the UCLA Library Special Collections unit. Users can find information on requesting reproductions, as well as the "Request to Publish Form" on their "Special Collections Reproductions" page, or you can email spec-coll@library.ucla.edu.
